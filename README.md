# Eaton_Bussmann_Series_Fuses

Commonly used in UNI-T multimeters at least in South Africa.

Would have been nice if the smaller more common 5mm fuses were used but these ceramic 6mm fuses are apparently better in quality.

Though they are more expensive and harder to find.

5mm fuses can loosly fit in the sockets, however you can also desolder and resolder the fuse sockets of the UNI-T to accommodate a smaller size but it's a royal pain in the rectum.
